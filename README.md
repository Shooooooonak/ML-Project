# ML-Project

This project aims to analyse historical economic growth trends using the German Credit Data dataset. This assessment aims to help you gain hands-on experience by developing and applying appropriate
machine learning models to help resolve ML for good problems by:

  ● Applying the appropriate machine learning methods for the respective problem statement.
  
  ● Analysing data quality and quantity of a dataset to determine if the data is sufficient.
  
  ● Comparing, interpreting, and communicating outputs from machine learning models.
  
  ● Suggesting ways to improve the models based on performance across all models.
